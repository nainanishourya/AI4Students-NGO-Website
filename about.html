                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>AI4Students is a dedicated Non-Governmental Organization committed to spreading awareness about Artificial Intelligence among school students, particularly those studying in classes 8 to 12. We work with students from government schools, private schools, and other educational institutions where structured AI education may not be formally introduced.</p>
                <p>Our initiative was born from the recognition that while AI is rapidly transforming the world, many students—especially from underserved communities—lack access to basic knowledge about this critical technology. We believe that every student deserves to understand AI, regardless of their school type or socioeconomic background.</p>

                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <p>AI4Students does not focus on advanced coding or complex technical training. Instead, we emphasize:</p>
                <ul class="approach-list">
                    <li><strong>Basic Awareness:</strong> Understanding what AI is, how it works in simple terms, and where it's used in daily life</li>
                    <li><strong>Practical Understanding:</strong> Real-world applications of AI that students can relate to</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsible Use:</strong> Ethics, safety, and responsible interaction with AI tools</li>
                    <li><strong>Future Readiness:</strong> Preparing students for a world where AI literacy is essential</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Learning:</strong> Engaging discussions and presentations that make learning fun</li>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Why AI Education Matters</h2>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence is no longer a future technology—it's here, transforming how we live, work, and learn. Students today will enter a job market where AI literacy is as important as basic computer skills were a generation ago.</p>
                <p>However, not all students have equal access to this knowledge. AI4Students exists to ensure that every student, regardless of their school or background, has the opportunity to understand and engage with this transformative technology.</p>
